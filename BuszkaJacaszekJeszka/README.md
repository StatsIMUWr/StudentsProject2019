Main functionalities:
  - data import (from Spotify's json files),
 
  - cleaning data and extracting implicit data (e.g. weekdays, semester from date)
 
  - filtering and summarizing data
    - most played / frequency of playing given track, artist, (and maybe genre) in given time period
    - what percentage of music played is from your playlists / library (or from given playlist) in given time period
    - how many songs were skipped and which were skipped the most in given time period
    - how long were the "sessions" of music listening (i.e. how long you listened to spotify with negligible breaks between songs) in given time period
    - percentage of time spent listening to spotify in given time period
    - shared songs, artist (provided that there is data from at least two different sources )
    - usage of different devices for spotify (based on search history data)
    - usage of spotify in different countries (based on search history data)
    - how often you have monothematic "subsessions" in "sessions" (i.e. listening to songs from the same artist for a longer period of time in one session)

  - music taste and habits visualization.
